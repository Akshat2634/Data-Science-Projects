# Fake News Detection

## Overview

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project, where I employed various machine learning algorithms to identify fake news within a given news corpus.

## Project Objective

- **Objective:** Develop a robust fake news detection model.
- **Dataset:** Utilized a dataset comprising 40,000 records, including both fake and authentic news articles.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Implemented text data preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
  - Transformed textual information into numerical features suitable for training machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- Employed a variety of machine learning algorithms:
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest

## Model Evaluation

- Trained and evaluated the fake news detection model using the mentioned algorithms.
- Achieved an impressive overall testing accuracy of 99.58%.
- The Decision Tree algorithm emerged as the highest-performing model in terms of accuracy.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different algorithms to enhance the fake news detection capabilities.
